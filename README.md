# Super Affiliate - Frontend Scaffold

This is a minimal Vite + React + Tailwind project scaffold implementing:
- Navbar with Theme toggle and Language switch (EN/VI)
- Home page with filters and table of programs
- Affiliate categories page
- Pricing and Theme pages

To run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project uses TailwindCSS dark mode (class on <html>). Theme is persisted to localStorage.
